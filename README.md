## Computational Time Analysis of Dense Matrix Operations in CPU and GPU
    
    1. Evaluated the execution time of Image Operations(Grey Scale Conversion , Translation , Filter(Gaussian) , Rotation) of different image Resolutions   on CPU and GPU.
    2. Image Resolution used for the project - (1024*768,1280*1024,1280*720,1920*1080)
    3. Framework for GPU - OpenGL and for CPU - OpenCV.
    4. Operations on GPU were 43% (Average) faster as compared to CPU.
